# Fracture Detection System

[![Deployment Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deployment-Active-green)](https://web-production-e4a9.up.railway.app/)

A **Fracture Detection System** using deep learning to detect fractures from medical X-ray images. This project leverages the power of **PyTorch** and **Torchvision** to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model is served via a **Flask** application, providing real-time predictions via a user-friendly web interface.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time fracture detection**: Upload an X-ray image, and the model will instantly predict whether a fracture is present.
- **Pre-trained CNN**: Built using PyTorch with transfer learning techniques for optimal performance.
- **Clean UI/UX**: Intuitive user interface designed for seamless interaction.
- **Deployed on Railway.app**: Stable, fast, and efficient deployment with zero downtime.

- **Pip** (Python package installer)
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prabhmeharbedi/fracture-detection.git
   cd fracture-detection

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux

3. **Install the Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the app locally**:

   ```bash
   python app.py

The app will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## 🚀 Deployment

To deploy this project, follow the [Railway.app Deployment Guide](https://railway.app/docs/deployments). Here's a quick guide:

1. **Install the Railway CLI**: Follow the [installation guide](https://railway.app/docs/cli).
2. **Link your project**: Use the CLI to link your project using the `railway link` command.
